  "description_long": "This is a coremod. It has almost no (apparent) impact on the game on its own. The primary purpose of this mod is to help authors write mods in a way that improves compatibility between mods.\r\nThis mod adds several aspects (some of which are hidden, and some are not) to manage slots for elements, recipes, and verbs that modders would otherwise often need to override. These slots include the slots for all Verbs (Dream, Explore, Relinquish, Scout, Send, Study, Talk, Travel, Use, and Work), slots for Rites (with separate aspects to regulate consuming and non-consuming slots), and recipes like the ones required to add new ascensions, or the \"talk to follower\" recipe.\r\nThis mod adds aspects that regulate the slots for rites, allowing modders to allow or forbid specific cards going into several possible groups of slot. This mod adds hidden aspects that modders can use to globally deny access to certain types of work, such as painting, Glover&Glover, begging, health-work, etc. This mod changes the way cultist exaltation works, making it easier for mods to make their own cults that are able, or unable, to raise specific types of exalt. This mod adds aspects that allow modders to disable certain types of hints when certain cards are in a Verb. Art by Genroa. Now with loc_zh integration, courtesy of Ivylili#6453. This localization data no longer conflicts with translation mods. (This mod no longer replaces internal decks, as a syntax has been discovered for editing internal decks directly.)\r\nCurrent version: 4.0.0.1"
